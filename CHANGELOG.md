## [0.3.2] — 2026-10-06

### Changed

- **Permission errors name the exact binary to grant.** Claude Desktop launches extensions through a helper that makes the spawned `uv` — not Claude — responsible for their privacy grants. Errors now print that `uv`'s path (e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/uv-runtime/uv-0.9.7-darwin-arm64/uv`) ready to paste into System Settings, and explain that enabling Claude is not enough, that one grant covers every Apple connector, and that it must be redone when Claude Desktop updates its `uv`.
- The Reminders-access error and the tag/linked-content store errors include those steps. They used to say to enable Claude, which has no effect.
- **README:** permissions now consistently point at `uv`, the restart step is consistently "quit Claude (⌘Q) and reopen it", and a new *Using several Apple connectors* section covers installing them one at a time, the shared `uv` grant, re-granting after updates, and verifying each connector.
- **Release flow aligned with the other Apple connectors.** Tag-triggered [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) and [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml), shared verbatim across the family, replace manual releases; this changelog was added and supplies each release's notes.
- CI checks that `manifest.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py`, and `uv.lock` agree on the version, and compares the manifest's tool list against the running server rather than a regex over its source.
